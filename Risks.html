				<h1>Risks of driverless cars</h1>
				</div>
				<div class="paragraph">
				<p><strong><u>Unemployment</u></strong><br>
					Although many people considering that automation would not lead to the loss of large number of jobs, with the technology thought to instead to changes in the nature of jobs rather than unemployment, jobs that are centred around driving are preparing for disruption from driverless vehicles. Automation will bring massive changes across the whole of society and those who drive for a living may be among the first to feel its effects[2]. When the driverless cars actually starting to enter the society, we need to think carefully about the plans that provide new opportunities for the people who are in the risk of unemployment, it allows them to adapt their skill set to the future society.
				</p>
				<p><strong><u>Cyber crime</u></strong><br>
					Any digital device connected to the internet is vulnerable to hacking. The driverless cars would heavily rely on the software to operate, and if a attacker can get into the system, then they would control every aspect of the car. Furthermore, the cars would also face that the theft of private data and the threat of computer virus. To mitigate the rist, autonomous vehicle cybersecurity defences need to be capable of dealing with threats in real time, recognizing malicious messages and stopping them from being distributed around the vehicle. This is a tough ask: the nature of threats will always change, meaning security systems need to be kept up to date. This generally requires periodic OTA updates, which themselves create openings for attack. Auto system developers therefore need to make sure their designs are fully protected. The V2V and V2I communications need to be encrypted, however it will raise the questions for the system designer, one example is that where and when do you decrypt a packet of data? The option can be on board the cars, it means that the data can be accessed by the vehicle directly. Problem is that it would require more processing power. Another option is that to send the data to a central server for decryption; this enables greater analysis to take place, but also greater latency. All these types of questions need to be considered carefully by system engineers to mitigate the upcoming cyber risks with driverless cars. Alongside the encryption itself there needs to be a secure authentication layer, to ensure data is coming from trusted sources.

				<p><strong><u>Computer malfunctions</u></strong><br>
				There is high possibility most self-driving cars would be made up of not one but tens or hundreds of computers. It increases the probability of software malfunction. Especially the software that operate driverless system would be sophisticated. There are many problems that enginners are currently facing, one example is how to operate smoothly in all weather conditions. To ensure the correctness of the driverless system, A number of formal tests and verfication methods need to be used to ensure the system functioning properly under every scenario we can think of. It would drastically reduce the probability of system fault.
				</p>
				<p><strong><u>An Unregulated Industry</u></strong><br>
				The information about the technology is limited and private, and although many car companies are jumping into the self-driving car space, there are not enough solid facts to create a baseline for safety standards. an unregulated industry is excellent for manufacturers but bad for consumers in terms of both safety and cost. Before driverless cars entering to the market, to specify the appropriate regulations would prompt the self-driving vehicles to be designed in a safer and cost-effective way </p>
