				<h1>Opportunities for innovation</h1>
				</div>
				<div class="paragraph">
				<p><strong><u>The potential future direction</u></strong><br>The current state-of-the-art are not capable of allowing the vehicles to automatically operate in a safe way<u>[2]</u>. The problems include blind spots, lack of accuracy for object recognition, high latency for V2V/V2I communications and more. There will be further developments to allow driverless cars become reality. And many researchers believe the development to solve the connectivity issue would be the next step of driverless car development and it will provide a number of opportunities for innovation in next decade. Although the mature self-driving system is unlikely to be deployed in next one to ten years, many people are planning for the upcoming chhanges.</p>

				<p>The source[1] suggests that Dedicated Short Range Communication(DSRC) could become the core technology of future self-driving cars. This technology can solve the current problem in V2V and V2I communications. It allows the communication to be low latency, high reliability, security, interoperability and more. The source[2] also mentioned that many researchers believe the connected system would be the most common system architecture of self-driving system.</p>
				<p>Vehicle-to-everything (V2X)(It includes V2V, V2I and other types of vehicle communication) is likely to be the main communication strategy of driverless cars. It allows vehicles to communicate with other cars, infrastructure and vulnerable road users to increase driver safety and smooth out the autonomous driving experience.Wifi or cellular based V2X technology (also known as DSRC or 5G). </p>
				<p>802.11p(DSRC) is used by original V2X communication. Vehicular Ad hoc NETwork(VANETs) is the network proposed to distribute the operations of driverless cars to agents. This information sharing strategy can eliminate the disadvantages(limited sensing range, bline spot and limited computational power) of an ego-only system to ensure safety and traffic efficiency.[2]</p>
				<p>Celluar networks is used by more recent V2X communication, this means that the drilverless cars can be integrated into 5g network seamlessly. The upcoming arrival of 5G connectivity will enhance the speed and reduce the latency of these safety-critical communications. In addition, because many pedestrians and bicyclists carry smartphones in their pockets, their precise locations may be more seamlessly transmitted to vehicles.</p>
				<p>The biggest advantage of DSRC over 5G is that it has been tested and vetted for more than a decade.</p>

				<p></p>
				<p><strong><u>Opportunities for innovation</u></strong><br>
				<p>With the fact that the development of the technologies(DRSC/5G) of V2X become more mature, many governments are planning for the change in future. Hence new opportunities arised for innovation for next decade.</p>
				<p><strong>Urban planning</strong><br>
					There would be the impact on the next few years on urban planning. It is estimated that cars sit unused for 95% of the time. That’s a lot of real estate tied up in driveways and parking spaces that could be profitably redeveloped, once the cars are removed from the equation. The driverless cars would become more practical with the advancements of its core technologies and the arrival of 5G. It is crucial to re-design the street and urban with the driverless cars in mind.
				</p>
				<p><strong>Cyber security</strong><br>
				If V2X is achieved in either way(DRSC/5G), every communication between vehicles and other objects would be transmitted through the network, this will put a huge pressure on the security part of the network as it directly relates to people's safety and privacy. Hence, future internet would require a big innovation to be more secure and now there is the trend many organisation(including driverless developing companies, goverments.etc) recruit more people in cyber security.</p>

				<p><Strong>Insurance</Strong><br>
				Insurance companies will face a radically new business landscape. If an owner is no longer responsible for driving a vehicle, they can’t be expected to be liable for damages, with the possible exceptions of failing to properly maintain or update the technology governing the car’s behaviour. The increased safety of driverless cars means premiums will be lower, making the environment harder for insurers even as the vehicles themselves are likely to become more expensive to repair, due to their greater reliance on high technology. In the next decade, the insurance companies will seek to change its strategy to face the more and more upcoming driverless cars.</p>
